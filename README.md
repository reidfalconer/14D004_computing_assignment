# 14D004 Computing Visualisation Assignment

## EDA of Traffic Accidents in the United Kingdom Between 2005-2015

This notebook sets out to conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on traffic accidents in the United Kingdom between 2005 and 2015. Specifically, this EDA will attempt to answer seven high-level research questions, which are outlined below. The focus of this notebook is primarily on data visualisation techniques rather than in-depth statistical analysis. However, this notebook will hopefully still provide some interesting insights and potential takeaways.

- How has the distribution of the age of casualties changed over time?
- Where do traffic accidents occur?
- What were the most dangerous and safest days to travel?
- Does accident severity differ across geographical locations?
- Does the casualty class of an accident differ across geographic areas?
- Do most accidents occur in "high-speed" zones?
- What time do traffic accidents occur?

## NB: Data
- The data is on road-traffic accidents in the UK from 2005 till 2015 and can be accessed at the following link: [https://data.gov.uk/dataset/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-safety-data](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-safety-data)
- The GIS shapefile data can be download at [http://www.diva-gis.org/datadown](http://www.diva-gis.org/datadown) or [directly](http://biogeo.ucdavis.edu/data/diva/adm/GBR_adm.zip)
